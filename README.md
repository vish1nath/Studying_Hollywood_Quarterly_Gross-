Studying the relationship between Hollywood’s total quarterly gross and movie with highest gross that quarter


In this analysis I am trying to understand the relationship between Hollywood’s total quarterly gross(sum of gross of all movies released in that quarter) and total number of  movies released in that quarter and with performance of movie with highest gross for that quarter.The data is collected from from boxofficemojo.com.The data is from first quarter of year 2000 to first quarter of year 2015,Having a total of 61 records.

We have three predictor variables,
- Total number of movies released in that quarter
- Gross of highest earning movie in that quarter
- Total number of theaters in which the highest earning movie of the quarter was screened.

The Total Gross of all movies released in that quarter is the target variable.The Total Gross for this analysis is considered in Million US Dollars
You can find the result of this analysis in Hollywood_Gross.docx and R code in moviegross.R
